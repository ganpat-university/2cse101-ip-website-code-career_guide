	<h3>What After Class 10?</h3>
	<p align="justify">‘What do I do after Class 10? Which stream should I opt for? Should I go for Commerce with Maths? My parents want me to take up Science but my interest lies in Humanities; what should I do? If you are one of the lakhs of students who have received their Class 10 Board Results in the last few weeks, these would be some of the questions that would be haunting you right now. JagranJosh is here with all the answers: opportunities after taking Science, Commerce and Humanities, what would work best for you, expert advice from experienced career counsellors – we’ve got it all for you right here!</p>
	<h3>TO Choose Right stream</h3>
	<p>Until now, all the major life decision, even your own name was decided by your parents. Therefore, ‘What to do after Class 10?’ will the first major decision that you have to take in your life. And with so many career choices and opportunities before you, at first, you might feel intimidated by them. But, upon closer examination, you will understand that choices are good and they empower you to pick the career option that you think is the best for your future.</p>
	<dl>
	  <dt>science stream</dt>
	  <dd>Science is easily the most attractive stream and the one that almost every parent wants their child to opt for. The Science stream offers you many lucrative career options such as engineering, medical, IT and computer science and even research in a variety of domains. The biggest advantage of opting for science stream for Class 10 students is that it allows them to shift streams (Arts or Commerce) later on in their academic career. Simply put, a Science student can opt for any subject from Arts or Commerce stream, if they are not comfortable with courses or specialization offered in it at the graduation level. On the contrary, Arts or Commerce students do not enjoy this option and are not allowed to pick science subjects for under graduate courses.As far as your Class 11th and 12th are concerned, you will have to deal with foundational science subjects i.e. Physics, Chemistry, Biology and Mathematics along with a few electives such as Computer Science, IT and Electronics. In addition to these, you will also have a compulsory language subject, depending upon the teaching medium you opt for. The teaching pedagogy will involve classroom teaching as well as practical training in laboratories. If you are interested in Engineering you can opt for PCM or Physics + Chemistry + Mathematics as core subjects, otherwise, you can pick PCMB or Physics + Chemistry + Mathematics + Biology, if medicine is the career that interests you.</dd>
	  <dt>commerce stream</dt>
	  <dd>Commerce is the second most popular stream among the Class 10 students as a career choice. If numbers, finances and economics are your forte, you must opt for Commerce Stream. As far as future career options are concerned, Commerce stream can lead you to some of the most lucrative and high paying jobs such as Chartered Accountants, Company Secretaries, Accountants, Investment Banking and Financial Advisors; although you will have to opt for professional courses in these respective domains post your Class 12.As a Commerce student, you will have Business Economics, Accountancy, Business Study and Business Law as your core subjects. In addition to this, you will also get foundational training in accounting, auditing, income tax, marketing and general business economics as part of the commerce stream. Just as the Science stream, students from Commerce also have a compulsory language subject.</dd>
	  <dt>Art's stream</dt>
	  <dd>Humanities or what is popularly known as the Arts stream is traditionally the least preferred option among Class 10 students but this perception is changing with time. Today, Arts stream has emerged as the widest study stream among all three, offering some interesting, off-beat and exciting career opportunities. Traditionally, the Arts stream was limited to students who were interested in academic research but this perception has changed in the last decade. Today, Arts students have a plethora of career options and most of them are equally lucrative and satisfying as the ones available through Science or Commerce streams. An Arts student can opt for career options like Journalism, Literature, Social Work, Teaching and many others.As far as subjects are concerned, Arts students have a variety of subjects to choose from which include sociology, history, literature, psychology, political science, philosophy, economics etc. Along with one compulsory language option, Arts students also have the choice to opt for a second language as well.</dd>
